This is a list of relationships between tables in the schema for the Walnut
Street Center patient database. In databases these are called functional
dependencies and are needed for the process of normalization. These functional
dependencies help maintain the integrity of the database and ensure that no
conflicting data is inserted into the database.
Every element in these relations derives from a table name that can be found in
the schema under back-end/models.py denoted by the __tablename__ under a class.

Key:
    ---     many-to-many (e.g. patients can have many doctors, doctors can have 
                               many patients)
    <--     one-to-many (e.g. a patient has one or more contacts)
    <->     one-to-one (e.g. a patient has one and only one set of basic info)

Note: A one to one relationship is the equivalent of them being in the same
      table. I may have separated for organization of information.
      Also note that some of these relationships are transitive, so there may
      exist a relationship that exists by traversing another.
      (e.g. patient <-> self_medication <-> appointment)

patient <-> basic_info    
patient --> program    
patient <-> legal_guardian_and_family_info    
patient <-> medical_info    
patient <-> identifying_info    

patient <-> self_medication    

patient <-> individual_support_plan    
patient <-> medical_treatment_plan    
patient <-> behavior_assessment    
patient <-> behavior_support_plan    
patient <-> rogers_monitor
